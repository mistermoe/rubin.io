        Chinese Massage Parlor
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Evening 23</h4>


    <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>In the evening of the 23rd, we took a trip over to a local massage parlor.
Before you crack any jokes about what goes on in the massage parlor (yes, that
does still exist if you want to find it), that’s not why we went to the massage
parlor. We went to kick back Shenzhen Style! No photos of this trip, for better
or for worse.</p>

<p>The massage parlor is kind of like a rest and relaxation hotel. You can stay
there all night if you want to. When we showed up, we had to give the
receptionist passports in accordance with Chinese law for overnight stays.</p>

<p>When you get to the parlor, you split off by gender, and then you take a
shower.</p>

<p>Next, there’s a large public bath (naked!) where you can go to enjoy some cool
refreshing water, ice cold water, and steamy hot water.</p>

<p>Following your dip in the public bath, you get a robe and slippers and head on
over to the main massage area. Here, you get a huge comfy recliner chair, the
kind you could easily sleep in.</p>

<p>Then, a host comes over and offers you the menu, where you can order various
beverages (such as watermelon juice or beer) and massages. Bunnie was trying to
order a green tea for a very long time, because he kept on accidentally saying
road fork (they both sound like “lu cha”).</p>

<p>Typically you start off with some light treatments, such as a foot massage or,
if you’re feeling like it, an ear scrape (I wasn’t bold enough so I stuck to
    the foot massage). Then, you can get a larger treatment if you like, your
    choice of different varieties of back massage, such as a Traditional
    Chinese Medicine or Thai Oil.</p>

<p>As I was told it was the most traditional was indeed the Traditional Chinese
Medicine Massage, I opted for that. A few minutes later, some doctors (of the
tcm variety) came to us and led us to the massage tables.</p>

<p>Now, I want to reserve my language somewhat, especially when it comes to
experiencing another culture, but FUCK EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TCM MASSAGE. It was
horrible, horrible pain for like an hour. The doctor systematically found every
pain and pressure point in my back and body and dug and jabbed them
mercilessly. As I squealed in pain, the doctor only laughed and prodded more.
If I had any secrets I’m sure he could have gotten me to reveal them.</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, my back was in pretty awful pain. I don’t think I’ll
be back for a TCM massage again, but I’d go back for a Thai Oil Massage (that’s
what you normally think of when you hear “massage”).</p>

<p>After the massage, there are some other facilities (such as ping pong) to hang
out and relax with, but I think I was too much in pain to want to take
advantage of that.</p>

<p>Overall, the massage parlor is a pretty good deal. For about 300RMB (around
~$50 USD) you get an overnight place to stay as well as massages and
entertainment. Would definitely recommend it for your trip out to Shenzhen, but
avoid the TCM massage.</p>

        Furniture Factory Tour
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 23</h4>


    <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>For Day 23 we’re going to take a look at a furniture factory. This is a HUGE
factory; probably the largest we saw on our trip, spanning many many hangars.
Unfortunately I didn’t take too many pictures at this factory.</p>

<p>We start our journey in the furniture factory with some basic processing of raw materials:</p>

        Precision Casting Factory Tour
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 20</h4>


    <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>The precision casting plant was really neat! They have some pretty major
clients, which you might be able to guess from some of the photos (but probably best
if this doesn’t show up in the search results).</p>

<p>This factory uses the cutting edge technologies to make über precise
components.</p>

<p>A precision mold starts with precision materials. The materials they make use
of here are void free, meaning that there are no microscopic pockets or bubbles
in the material which would make it hard to machine precisely.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/megdqy2lxlnd3fm/voidfree.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
Pretty sure this specific piece is tungsten.</p>

<p>The blanks are then given a rough CNC cut, and then brought to a precision
grinder where a worker uses a device to trim all edges. The device scales all
of the workers movements by a large factor, and greatly magnifies the part. A
bouncing rotary tool allows the worker to grind away slowly.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4x2b05ds2o0eux2/cut.gif?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The next step is an ablation process which uses a super high current arc to
blast off material bit by bit and polish the mold and give it a mirror finish
(if I recall correctly).</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oyag7ev874vohmm/ablate.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The polished mold pieces are very pretty!</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e2sq59sqpj393j7/moldpieces.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The finished pieces are then assembled into a mold housing.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3hu5hvlzusjqsal/moldassemble.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The parts are made by injection molding a metal powder into the mold. These are
very delicately held together, you could easily snap them with your bare hands.</p>

<p>They are then forged at high heat, which bonds the metal, making it very strong.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/84glx83udxsefoo/part.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
Hmm… where have I seen this part in the wild ;)</p>

<p>Overall, this is a process you could hope-to-afford one day when either prices
come down, your company is doing really well, or you are operating in a niche
that requires it. Despite being somewhat inaccessible, it was really cool to
get to see how it all comes together!</p>

        Mannequin Factory Tour
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 20</h4>


    <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>A question you dread your child asking – where do mannequins come from?</p>

<p>Well in today’s blog, we’ll find out!</p>

<p>This factory was very perspective changing. Usually, people think of China as
being for knock-off or unoriginal products, but the Mannequin Factory was
somewhat akin to a pop-art-at-scale Andy Warhol-esque plant. There were a lot of
original ideas and very skilled hand craftsmen. The company owner/head artist
was a very charismatic Chinese man, he gave us a really wonderful tour of his
facility!</p>

<p>Check out some of the really cool pieces designed here:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2pazk2z8pmg4pyb/copper.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p3cvvngoizpg86p/trio.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>A mannequin starts with a sculptor making a small mockup to play with style and
form:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vgc343jv7xnagk9/miniman.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Then the sculptor produces a master mannequin:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qnnv9ky97uqlp4m/wireframe.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />

<p>From that mannequin, molds are made:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/36t4joza2kkmfls/mold.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>From the molds, mannequins are cast:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n43vt195oz4q4ng/glass.gif?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />

A particularly sad looking mold curing.</p>

<p>The factory operates at a pretty large scale!</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bwb58fzt7d7lzwa/scale.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
A lot of casts being made!</p>

<p>I like this show because you can see casts being freshly opened and queued for
the next phase.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppnuf53hatcjucx/opening.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After casting, the mannequins are powdercoated/painted/glossed.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gqmncv9mad2fkcl/painting.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After painting, blemishes are marked and repaired:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2x84xoewd6mvlcn/blem.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
Red tape is used to mark the faults.</p>

<p>Optionally, cosmetics (or other finishing touches) are applied:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/y14zu3padyyb6cl/cosmetics1.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The Archives:</p>

<p>They keep copies of various parts of mannequins that they have produced in the
past, in case they want to reference old work.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ov303y4jd3xx0py/archive.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

Headroom?</p>

<h2 id="water-treatment">Water Treatment</h2>

<p>This factory also has an on-site water treatment facility</p>

<p>It was not quite as involved as the one at the leather treatment facility, but
this factory does do a lot of sanding and painting so they treat their waste
water on-site.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h1aal3z0pfqipgl/water.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<h2 id="oddities">Oddities</h2>

<p>There are definitely odd things to see in a mannequin factory, or if not odd,
visually striking sights. Here are a few images, left without comment:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/egatm1nrt2uuo1i/oddity1.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/abkgj1jp4g4ecnb/oddity4.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<h3 id="lastly">Lastly</h3>

<p>I got a really fantastic parting gift at this factory… an arm!</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxx9rs7oajwwx4k/gift.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>This will be fun to take through customs…</p>

<p>I’d love to do a project with it like turn it into a handy desk lamp. It’s made
of a very nice quality wood.</p>

        Zipper Factory Tour
      </a>
  </h2>
  <h4>Shenzhen Adventure Day 19</h4>


    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>

    <p>The Zipper factory tour was courtesy of <a href="http://danielliang.com/randomness/">Daniel Liang</a>.
This was one of the more detailed tours; there’s a whole lot that goes into a zipper! Daniel’s factory
is also super large as it is essentially end-to-end, raw materials go in such as bulk plastic and metal, and 
finished spools of zipper material and zips come out.</p>

<h2 id="filament-making">Filament Making</h2>

<p>Filaments are used to make the plastic zipping ribs.</p>

<p>They start out as raw plastic pelts.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n8br4vzqq44xze7/raw_pelts.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>If a black color is desired, a small amount of dye pellets are added.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7l965n0n6di2wt4/dyed_pelts.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The pellets go into the hopper (far left) to be melted down/mixed and then extruded.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jp0i21hx2k4ehkh/filament_pano.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get great pictures of this part, but the filaments are
pulled through, cooled, and then spooled.</p>

<p>Maybe this picture will help you, but I can’t really make sense of it.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/749pvs877ijxpfc/extruded.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<h2 id="tape-weaving">Tape Weaving</h2>

<p>Tapes are woven from some nylon/cotton thread. I’m not sure if this is made on
site or not, but I think if I recall it is a separate factory.</p>

<p>The thread goes into weaving machines.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ewpefmt4c3hfgoi/weaver3.gif?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
Weaving machine, slowed down many times.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xqmq8galwcy6w2o/weaverarray.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
Many arrays of weaving machines. Each machine weaves several tapes at once.</p>

<h1 id="zip-integrating">Zip Integrating</h1>

<p>These machines knit in the filaments into a plastic zipper. This is either onto a woven tape, or standalone (both are pictured below).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tf9ije2g7k0wku9/knit-tape.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sde4tpradlqmrmz/standalone.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" /></p>

<h2 id="slider-making">Slider Making</h2>

<p>A Zipper Slider starts out
looking like this:</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/30yzyuzpifdwl8e/IMG_0404.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />

<p>The metal is melted down and sent to die casting molds.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7dc639ray9w58j0/diecastscale.JPG?raw=1" alt="" class="center-image" />
